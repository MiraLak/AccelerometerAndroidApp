Each acceleration contains:

    date when it has been captured as a timestamp (eg, 1428773040488)
    acceleration force along the x axis (unit is m/s²)
    acceleration force along the y axis (unit is m/s²)
    acceleration force along the z axis (unit is m/s²)

# Prerequisites
Android Studio https://developer.android.com/sdk/index.html
